# Killing of the Dead

KotD is a simple "typing" game for the Pico-8 fantasy console created in late 2019 as a learning project. It was initially designed to "type" with the on-screen keyboard controlled either with the mouse or arrow keys. Since that was a horrible way to play I added the ability to use a keyboard as well. 

The game can be played in a browser <a href="doomlazer.github.io/KotD">here</a>.

# How to play 

By default the game starts with only the arrow keys and mouse enabled. Press "k" to enable a physical keyboard. 

Type "start" to begin the game.

Gameplay is fairly limited. Type the word shown just above the keyboard to shoot the approaching zombie hordes. 

Occasionally, a bonus word will appear at the top of the screen. It can be typed at any time instead of the current word to "Bomb" all enemies or gain temp rapid fire.
